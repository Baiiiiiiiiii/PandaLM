It was founded in 1937 and has been a pivotal platform for student filmmakers, showcasing their work and fostering a community of cinematic talent.\n\n\nPlease note that while UCLA's University Film Society is one of the longest-running, the title of \"longest\" could vary depending on the criteria used (e.g., number of years, number of active members, or number of films produced). It's also possible that there are other societies with similar longevity that have not been as widely recognized.",

If you have a specific country in mind, please let me know so I can provide more tailored information, keeping in mind that the latest updates may not be included. \n\nFor well-known examples, the Cambridge University Film Association in the United Kingdom has a long history dating back to 1947 and is one of the older societies of its kind in the world. However, to determine if it's the longest continuously running student film society would require more specific current data and comparisons with other similar societies globally.",

Although there is not a specific widely recognized date when these problems were formally published or presented as a well-defined set, it is generally understood that his conjectures on the fundamental aspects of quantum liquids were formulated and became known to the scientific community during this period.

After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 by Louis XIV, which had previously granted religious freedom to the Huguenots in France, many sought refuge in Protestant countries. England, under the rule of King William III, who was a Calvinist, became a significant destination due to the relatively tolerant religious environment.

The Dutch Republic was one of the foremost Protestant powers in Europe at the time and had a long history of providing sanctuary to religious minorities. Many Huguenots found a strong Calvinist community there, which helped facilitate their integration.\n\n2. **England:** England also emerged as a prime destination for Huguenot refugees. The English provided support and assistance to the Huguenots as part of their broader conflict with Catholic France under Louis XIV. England passed several acts to protect and encourage Protestant refugees from France and elsewhere, seeing them as religious brethren and useful skilled workers.\n\nThese countries not only provided refuge from persecution but also opportunities for the Huguenots to contribute to local industries with their skills, particularly in textiles and manufacturing.",
