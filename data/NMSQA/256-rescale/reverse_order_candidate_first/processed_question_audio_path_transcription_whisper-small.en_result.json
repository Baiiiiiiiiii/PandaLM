It was founded in 1937 and has been a pivotal platform for student filmmakers, showcasing their work and fostering a community of cinematic talent.\n\n\nPlease note that while UCLA's University Film Society is one of the longest-running, the title of \"longest\" could vary depending on the criteria used (e.g., number of years, number of active members, or number of films produced). It's also possible that there are other societies with similar longevity that have not been as widely recognized.",

This means that individuals with higher incomes will pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes compared to those with lower incomes.\n\nThe progressive tax system is based on the principle of vertical equity, which states that individuals with a higher ability to pay should contribute more to the tax revenue. This system aims to reduce income inequality and redistribute wealth in a more balanced manner.\n\nIn a progressive tax system, tax brackets are used to determine the tax rate applied to different levels of income. Each tax bracket has a specific income range and a corresponding tax rate. As an individual's income increases and crosses into a higher tax bracket, the tax rate applied to the income within that bracket increases.\n\nFor example, consider a simplified progressive tax system with three tax brackets:\n\n- Income up to $20,000: 10% tax rate\n- Income between $20,001 and $50,000: 20% tax rate\n- In",

        "response1": "The concept of a fairy carrying a weight is a fictional one, as fairies are mythical creatures without a defined physical form or capabilities in the real world. However, in various folklore and fantasy literature, fairies are often depicted as being able to carry small objects or even people. For example, in some stories, a fairy might be able to carry a small child or a tiny object like a flower.\n\nSince fairies are not real and do not have a specific carrying capacity, it's not possible to provide a factual answer to this question. If you're referring to a specific fairy from a book, movie, or game, please provide more details, and I can help you interpret the character's abilities within that fictional context.",
