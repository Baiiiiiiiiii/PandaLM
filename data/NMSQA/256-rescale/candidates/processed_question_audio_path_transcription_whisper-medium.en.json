    "The term \"white pestis\" is not a commonly used term in historical or medical contexts.

    "A progressive tax system is designed to tax individuals based on their ability to pay. In this system, the tax rate increases as the taxable base amount, which is typically the individual's income, increases. This means that those who earn more pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes compared to those who earn less.\n\nFor example, in a progressive tax system, a person with a lower income might pay a tax rate of 10%, while a person with a higher income might pay a tax rate of 30%. The tax brackets are usually set up in such a way that the higher income earners pay a larger share of their income in taxes, while the lower income earners pay a smaller share.\n\nThis system is based on the principle of vertical equity, which states that individuals with a higher ability to pay should contribute more to the tax system. Progressive taxes are often used to reduce income inequality and provide more resources for public services and social programs.\n\nIn summary, a progressive tax system increases the tax rate as the taxable base amount (income) increases, ensuring that those with higher incomes contribute a larger share of their income to the tax system. This helps to",
