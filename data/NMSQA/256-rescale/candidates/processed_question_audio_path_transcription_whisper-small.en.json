    "A progressive tax system is designed to tax individuals based on their ability to pay. In this system, the tax rate increases as the taxable income or base amount increases. This means that individuals with higher incomes will pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes compared to those with lower incomes.\n\nThe progressive tax system is based on the principle of vertical equity, which states that individuals with a higher ability to pay should contribute more to the tax revenue. This system aims to reduce income inequality and redistribute wealth in a more balanced manner.\n\nIn a progressive tax system, tax brackets are used to determine the tax rate applied to different levels of income. Each tax bracket has a specific income range and a corresponding tax rate. As an individual's income increases and crosses into a higher tax bracket, the tax rate applied to the income within that bracket increases.\n\nFor example, consider a simplified progressive tax system with three tax brackets:\n\n- Income up to $20,000: 10% tax rate\n- Income between $20,001 and $50,000: 20% tax rate\n- In",
